# AlgorithmBootcamp
This is a repo for algorithm implementation. 
The most common algorithms are implemented, and the main purpose of doing this is to familiarize myself with the algorithm while keeping the habit of coding every day.
The initial version is completed through java and python.
There will be more languages implementation in future.(Wish I get time to do this lol)
