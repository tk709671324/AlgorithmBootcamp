# AlgorithmBootcamp
This is a repo for algorithm implementation. </br>
The most common algorithms are implemented, and the main purpose of doing this is to familiarize myself with the algorithm while keeping the habit of coding every day.</br>
The initial version is completed through java and python.</br>
There will be more languages implementation in future.(Wish I get time to do this lol)</br>
